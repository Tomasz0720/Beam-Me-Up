### Description
This machine learning model aims to predict the number of UFO sightings in Canadian provinces and American states during 2016.
This model covers a supervised regression problem, where the goal of the model is to estimate a numerical value (daily sighting count) based on historical patterns.
The neural network learns temporal patterns (i.e. the months that have more recorded sightings) and geographical patterns (i.e. states/provinces that historically reported more UFO activity).
